*Description*:

A radically new kind-of website where we track a person's work towards cleaning their surroundings. 
Especially their work towards getting rid of excess plastics and plastic bottles in the environment.
A technologically new kind of dustbins are placed in the public areas and its features include determining the amount of plastic or unbiodegradable articles deposited or thrown in it.
The dustbins can also track which user of the website has thrown the waste in it by input from the user before depositing.
Then the dustbins can upload those numbers to the servers daily or weekly depending upon the amount and place its placed in.
These numbers can help increment the number of credits or stars a user has.
Which then can be spent on a number of gift coupons and vouchers.
It is free to register and revenue works on the selling of the recyclable garbage.
It helps the environment while also rewarding the users and people who are trying to create a change in the world.
